<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Verdana">Monkey's Audio Source Code
Readme<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">(last updated July 7, 2002)</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Introduction</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First off, just to be clear, you have to fully
agree with the included license agreement before using / viewing any of the
included materials.&nbsp; The big points are that you can't steal code or try to
make money with it (without permission) and that you have to submit changes and
improvements back to the Monkey's Audio project.&nbsp; With that out of the way,
I'm hoping that by releasing the source code, we'll be able to work together to
make Monkey's Audio better.&nbsp; Please direct any suggestions or improvements
to the Monkey's Audio developer's forum or to me personally when appropriate.
(email @ monkeysaudio.com)&nbsp; And thank you for taking the time to help.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Important Note</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Monkey's Audio format is not
&quot;finalized&quot;.&nbsp; In fact, the compression / decompression engines
are continually being improved.&nbsp; This is what makes MAC fun to work on, and
it's what makes progress possible.&nbsp; I realize that this can be a pain for
3rd party developers, but it's the only way to avoid stagnation.&nbsp; So, you
can not hard code Monkey's Audio support and expect it to work with the newest
versions of MAC forever.&nbsp; Either use a DLL or else accept that you'll have
to re-link to MACLib once in a while.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Things that it'd be great if you worked on</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. It would be nice to have makefiles for gcc
or any other compilers that people commonly use.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Pour through the code and look for bone-head
maneuvers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Submit any necessary changes for
cross-platform compilation.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. XMMS, Lame DLL, PocketPC, etc. plugins /
implementations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. A console front-end that doesn't suck. (more
options, etc.)&nbsp; Also, don't worry about maintaining compatibility with the
current parameter passing scheme -- just use whatever makes sense.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tips for building MACLib outside of Windows</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. in &quot;Shared/All.h&quot; do this:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">#define BUILD_CROSS_PLATFORM</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">look through &quot;Shared/All.h&quot; and
    &quot;Shared/NoWindows.h&quot; to make sure all the defines are acceptable</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2. You need to use NASM to build the assembly
if you want it. (helps speed a lot)&nbsp; Check out &quot;MacLib/Assembly/...&quot;
for more information.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Known non-Windows problems (help fixing them
would be great)</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The macros PUMP_MESSAGE_LOOP, MESSAGEBOX, and a few others don't work.</font></p>
