MAC: short for Monkey's Audio Codec, a lossless audio codec (almost with the .ape extension).

This is the MAC Linux port. I have added the autoconf and automake stuff and 
made some slight changes for the codes.

Since 3.99 update 4 build 4, mac-port has support for big endian platforms,
and has been tested in MAC OSX 10.4, Linux PowerPC and SunOS Sparc, 
but need more tests in more OSes and more Platforms.

Since 3.99 update 4 build 5, mac-port has support for AMD64.
