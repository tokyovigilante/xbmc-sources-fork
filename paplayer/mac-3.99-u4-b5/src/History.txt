History:

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 4

1. Fixed: Decoder could erroneously report a CRC error on the last frame of some files.

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 3

1. Changed: Worked on making data types more standard / cross-platform friendly.
2. Changed: Switched code from tab-based to space based. (may still be some out-of-whack formatting)
3. Fixed: Building ID3 tags could cause a crash.
4. Fixed: APL builder treated the last part of a CUE time as a hundreth of a second instead of as a frame. (1 / 75 of a second)
5. Fixed: File Info dialog used by Winamp plugin wouldn't accept / save Unicode tag values properly.
6. Fixed: APL files could output noise or silence at the end of the file in some cases.

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 2

1. Fixed: Possible buffer overflow attack weakness in APE tagging code.
2. Fixed: MACDll.dll was not doing ANSI to Unicode conversions properly.
3. Changed: Added Unicode versions of interface wrappers to MACDll.dll.
4. Changed: Updated Winamp plugin to better handle Unicode.
5. Changed: Removed peak-level normalize from file and Winamp plugin. (newer players can do normalize / replay gain during playback)
6. Changed: Updated Cool Edit filter to 3.99.

Monkey's Audio 3.99 Update 1

1. Fixed: MACDll.dll wasn't working on Win9x / ME systems.
2. Changed: MAC.exe updated to 3.99.

Monkey's Audio 3.99

1. Changed: Decoding engine better at handling corrupt streams / loss of internet connection while playing.
2. Changed: Simplified assembly code building for 3rd party developers.
3. NEW: Improved entropy coder for increased compression.
4. Changed: Removed RKAU support. (since it is no longer commonly used)

Monkey's Audio 3.98a1

1. Changed: Now natively using APE tag version 2 tagging. (updated spec for better streaming and international support)
2. Changed: Using smaller frame sizes with Fast, Normal, and High for faster, smoother seeking.
3. NEW: Added built-in MD5 checking, for super secure, super fast file verification.
4. Changed: Using a new and improved file header format.
5. NEW: Added "Insane" mode for when compression is all that matters.
6. NEW: Introduced new GUI.
	- full Unicode support
	- few or no dependencies
	- multi-thread friendly -- can process multiple files at once
	- XML based external plugin architecture

Monkey's Audio 3.97 (July 7, 2002)

1. Changed: "Save File List Between Sessions" now on by default in front end.
2. Changed: Replaced usage of "#pragma once" with more non-MS compiler friendly alterternative.
3. NEW: MakeAPL now supports command line APL generation. (pass a .CUE file (no wildcards yet) -- operates in silent mode using existing settings)
4. Changed: Assembly support no longer required for backwards compatibility. (thanks Torgeir Strand Henriksen)
5. Changed: Several non-Windows buildability issues.
6. Changed: Using NASM to compile all assembly code. (aids cross-platform buildability)
7. Changed: Encapsulated the APELink code.
8. Changed: Tags aren't analyzed immediately when opening an http:// or m01p:// stream.
9. Changed: Added more functionality to the APL parser.
10. Changed: Added CreateIAPEDecompressEx2(...) to allow the creation of a ranged decoder.

Monkey's Audio 3.96 (April 7, 2002)

1. Fixed: WAV analysis could hang on invalid wav files.
2. Changed: Monkey's Audio would try to analyze files with file extensions not related to Monkey's Audio.
3. NEW: Added APE_DECOMPRESS_AVERAGE_BITRATE field so APL's can report the bitrate for the region they represent.
4. Changed: Improved overall non-Windows build-ability. (MACLib.lib doesn't require <windows.h> to build)
5. Changed: APL parser no longer requires Windows.
6. Fixed: APE tagging code would fail to save tags for files with existing ID3v1 tags.
7. Fixed: MakeAPL would not run on Win95 / 98.
8. Changed: More non-Windows build-ability issues.
9. Changed: Minor assembly optimizations. (like a 2% performance improvement)
10. Changed: MACLib now builds with gcc under Linux. (no backwards compatibility or assembly support yet)
11. Fixed: Bitstream fix / change that may have accounted for decompression failures in extremely rare cases.
12. Changed: Slight NNFilter optimization. (thanks to Chun-Yu Shei)
13. Changed: Turned off "Explorer" by default for the Monkey's Audio GUI. (doesn't work well under XP... will still leave it in for a while)
14. Changed: Included the WavPack 3.93.
15. Changed: Changed the history reporting method.
