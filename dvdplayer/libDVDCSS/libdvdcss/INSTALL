INSTALL file for libdvdcss, a DVD access library


Configuring libdvdcss
=====================

A typical way to configure libdvdcss is:

   ./configure --prefix=/usr

See `./configure --help' for more information.

Building libdvdcss
==================

Once configured, run `make' to build libdvdcss.

If you have player keys, you need to put them in the file csskeys.h, before
configuring libdvdcss to enable the "key" method (the one from libcss).


Installing libdvdcss
====================

You can install libdvdcss by typing:

   make install


Building libdvdcss for Win32
============================

You have two alternatives to build libdvdcss for Win32:

- natively on Windows, using MSYS + MINGW (www.mingw.org):

 (MSYS is a minimal build environnement to compile unixish projects under
  windoze. It provides all the common unix tools like sh, gmake...)

 You will need to download and install the latest MSYS (version 1.0.7 as
 of now) and MINGW.
 The installation is really easy. Begin with the MSYS auto-installer and once
 this is done, extract MINGW into c:\msys\1.0\mingw. You also have to remember
 to remove the make utility included with MINGW as it conflicts with the one
 from MSYS (just rename or remove c:\msys\1.0\mingw\bin\make.exe).

 http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-1.1.tar.gz

 To build libdvdcss you just have to run the following commands:
  ./configure
  make

- or on Linux, using the mingw32 cross-compiler:

 You can find a mingw32 cross-compiler on the videolan web site:
 http://www.videolan.org/vlc/windows.html
 Or if you are running Debian, there is a mingw32 package you can use.

 If you are cross-compiling from the Debian package, you can use the following
 commands:

  ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc \
  --build=i386-linux

  make

 If you are cross-compiling using the mingw32 package provided by
 www.videolan.org, you have to use something along those lines:

  CC=/usr/local/cross-tools/bin/i586-mingw32msvc-gcc \
  PATH=/usr/local/cross-tools/bin:$PATH \
  ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc \
  --build=i386-linux

  PATH=/usr/local/cross-tools/bin:$PATH make
