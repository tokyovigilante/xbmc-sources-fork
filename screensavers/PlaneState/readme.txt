Planestate Screensaver for XBox Media Center
By Joakim Eriksson <je@plane9.com>
The TestXBS framework and program is made by Warren

This screensaver is based on my old windows planestate screensaver that
can be found at http://www.plane9.com.

The screensaver uses diffrent configurations. A configuration is a specific
setting on the currently around 210 diffrent values that can be set.
These configurations gets picked at run time according to a probability
factor so you might need to run the screensaver a few times before you
have seen all of them.

The windows screensaver has a real configuration gui so if you want to
create new configurations I suggest you use that screensaver then write
down all values and add them to this one.
