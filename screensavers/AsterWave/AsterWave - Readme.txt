AsterWave by Asteron

Silverwave will choose a random image within this folder as a texture.
Images can be of the following formats.

.bmp, .dds, .dib, .hdr, .jpg, .pfm, .png, .ppm, and .tga 

Most image resolutions work but powers of 2 should be better, 512x512 is recommended.

To test a texture just place it in this folder and remove the other pictures.

Enjoy!
