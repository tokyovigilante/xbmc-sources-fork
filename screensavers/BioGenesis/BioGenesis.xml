<!-- This is an iterative mathematical function over a grid of cells -->
<!-- This function borders the boundary of stability and chaos -->
<!-- While the grid is initially populated by random noise structures quickly see structures emerge -->
<!-- Some of these structures are quite rare and fun to spot -->
<!-- See http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/freq_top_life.html for a frequency table -->
