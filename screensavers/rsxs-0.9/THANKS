Many thanks to (in no special order):

* Terry Welsh, for writing the screensavers in the first place. And releasing
	the source!
* Jeff Gibson, for pointing out an incompatibility with older versions of g++.
* Bret Towe, for a useful Makefile patch.
* Ari Pollak, for packaging rsxs for Debian.
* Phillip Pi, for suggesting the configure script should let the user choose
	the screensavers to install.
* Florian Thiel, for testing with g++ 2.95 and finding some bugs.

... and to everyone that's downloaded and tried this package out!
