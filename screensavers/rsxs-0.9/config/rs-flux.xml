This screen saver started as an experiment with strange attractors.  After
playing with some simple strange attractor equations, it became clear that
they could be much more beautiful if the constants could be varied over time.

This required the introduction of some limiting terms into the equations that
prevented the values from flying off to infinity.  So these aren't genuine
strange attractors anymore, but they look much better.
