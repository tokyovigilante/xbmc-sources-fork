My savers seem to be all about color and movement.  This one is certainly no
exception.  It just shows that a little random math can go a long way.

Solar Winds started out as a simple particle effects saver, but once I saw
that the particles usually stayed in continuous lines I gave them some
connectivity and threw in the "lines" option.
