Company History</H1><P>GoAhead 
            Software, headquartered in Bellevue, Wash., was founded by CEO Michael 
            O'Brien in 1995 to develop software for managing complex 
            infrastructure devices. His work with system performance and 
            monitoring products revealed a critical need for management tools 
            that could solve device-specific problems without user intervention. 
            GoAhead 
            is well positioned for growth with investment backing from Columbia 
            Capital, Voyager Capital, Intel and Cedar Grove Investments.
