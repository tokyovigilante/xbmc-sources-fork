              Our goal in releasing GoAhead WebServer under an open source license 
              is to help put a Web server in every device, harness the pool of 
              talented developers, and enhance the reliability of GoAhead WebServer 
              by leveraging the test and debugging efforts of thousands of companies. 
               </P><P> <I><B>What 
              is the GoAhead WebServer?</B></I> <A NAME="2"></A><BR>
              The GoAhead WebServer is a fully functional, standards-based embedded 
              web server designed for cross-platform support. Its functionality 
              includes Active Server Pages (ASP) for delivering dynamic HTML pages, 
              in-process CGI, embedded JavaScript and an open, extensible scripting 
              architecture.  </P><P> <I><B>Why 
              use the GoAhead WebServer?</B></I> <A NAME="3"></A><BR>
              Not only is GoAhead WebServer a fast, efficient, high-end Web server, 
              but it is also based on industry standards and royalty free. Many 
              companies have developed Web servers that range in price from a 
              few thousand dollars to nearly $100,000 when the royalty fees are 
              incurred. Most commercial Web servers also define proprietary tags 
              which require you to use their development tools or learn new languages. 
              GoAhead WebServer uses industry standards like JavaScript and ASP 
              so you don't have to change the way you work.  </P><P> <I><B>What 
              is included with the source code?</B></I> <A NAME="4"></A><BR>
              The distribution includes GoAhead WebServer source code written 
              in C, makefiles, and reference platforms for Windows CE, Wind River 
              VxWorks, Linux, Lynx, eCos, and Windows 95/98/NT.  </P><P> <I><B>What 
              standards does the the GoAhead WebServer conform to?</B> </I><A NAME="5"></A><BR>
              The GoAhead WebServer conforms to HTTP 1.0 and includes some performance 
              enhancements of HTTP 1.1 including persistent connections. The architecture 
              is also compatible with the GoAhead Embedded Management Framework. 
              </P><P> <I><B>How 
              fast is it?</B></I> <A NAME="6"></A><BR>
              GoAhead WebServer can service 20 requests per second on a 24MHz 
              68040, 50/sec on 266 MHz Pentium and draws on GoAhead's PC Magazine 
              Editor's Choice award winning internet accelerator technology.  </P><P> <I><B>How 
              big is the code?</B></I> <A NAME="7"></A><BR>
              The footprint of the compiled version of the embedded server in 
              a Windows CE environment is less than 60K of code. </P><P> <I><B>Does 
              the GoAhead WebServer support dynamic pages?</B></I> <A NAME="8"></A><BR>
              Yes, utilizing embedded JavaScript, Active Server Pages, and in-process 
              CGI. </P><P> <I><B>What 
              are the benefits of Active Server Pages?</B></I> <A NAME="9"></A><BR>
              An Active Server Page (ASP) is an HTML page that is processed on 
              the  web server before the page is sent to the user.  The script 
              in the web page accesses data or a designated API and then builds 
              or customizes the page "on the fly" before sending it to the requester. 
              Active Server Pages is an open technology framework and can use 
              scripts written in C++, Visual Basic, and Java. Active Server Pages 
              is the premier standards based method for creating dynamic web pages. 
              Rather than using a proprietary method of integrating dynamic data 
              into a page, ASP is a pervasive 2nd generation standard pioneered 
              by Microsoft.  </P><P> <I><B>Does 
              the GoAhead WebServer have any level of security?</B> </I><A NAME="10"></A><BR>
              Yes, security for the GoAhead WebServer is supported via the basic 
              encoding HTTP/1.0 standard.  </P><P> <I><B>Are 
              tools available to help the development and integration process?</B></I> 
              <A NAME="11"></A><BR>
              Yes, GoAhead’s Embedded Management Framework integrated development 
              environment provides a rapid application development environment. 
              </P><P> <I><B>What 
              are the licensing terms?</B> </I><A NAME="12"></A><BR>
              View the license. All GoAhead asks is that you notify GoAhead before 
              you ship product, help promote the Web server by placing the GoAhead 
              WebServer logo on your device's home page, agree to act as a reference 
              customer, and submit any enhancements of the code back to GoAhead. 
               </P>
      <P> <I><B>How is the GoAhead WebServer supported?</B></I> <A NAME="13"></A><BR>

      <P> <I><B>Which 
              platforms are supported?</B></I> <A NAME="14"></A><BR>
              GoAhead provides the GoAhead WebServer source code for six reference 
              platforms, Windows CE, Wind River Systems VxWorks, Linux, Lynx, 
              eCos, and Windows 95/98/NT. The code has been tested on a number of
