Since it isn't a kernel and code manages to get quite complex we aren't using
Linus coding style. Do not point me his arguments about tabs and such.

Rules:

- no hard tabs, I'll purge any \t in the source soon
- 4char indent
- 79 col per line

In short the code should match the FFmpeg coding style.

Namespaces:

Public functions currently use layer specific namespace:

- rtp related functions should use the "rtp_" namespace.
- rtsp related functions should use the "rtsp_" namespace.
- sdp related functions should use the "sdp_" namespace.

Private functions should ALL use nms_ if they are shared across modules, 
exception to this rule:

- static functions
- inline functions
