This software, derived from the experience matured with NeMeSi is fully compliant with IETF's standards for real-time streaming of multimedia contents over Internet. libnemesi implements RTSP – Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RFC2326) and RTP/RTCP – Real-Time Transport Protocol/RTP Control Protocol (RFC3550) supporting the RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RFC3551).

The library provides two different API:

    * high level: the simplest abstraction to get the demuxed streams out of a resource uri
    * low level: provides access to all the rtp, rtcp, rtsp primitives in order to develop advanced applications.
