XBMCProjectM should be checked out or copied into the XBMC source directory under "visualisations".

projectM now uses cmake, so get it:
sudo apt-get install cmake

For complete projectM build instructions see:
http://projectm.wiki.sourceforge.net/Installation+Instructions

Unset CC and CXX environment variables or you'll upset CMake:
unset CC
unset CXX

Quick and dirty projectM build instructions:
cd libprojectM
ccmake .
Hit 'c' to configure.
Ignore the FTGL warning and hit 'e'.
Change CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to "Release".
Hit 'c' to configure, again.
Ignore the FTGL warning and hit 'e', again.
Hit 'g' to generate Makefile.
make
cd ..

To build the .vis:
