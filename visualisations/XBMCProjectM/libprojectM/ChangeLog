*Hai Zaar helped us clean up the autotools stuff
         -Presets/fonts will be stored in $DATADIR/projectM/fonts and /presets
         -The config file will be stored in $SYSCONFDIR/projectM
         -By default DATADIR is $PREFIX/share and SYSCONFDIR is $PREFIX/etc
             so we reccomend you run configure like so:
	          
	     ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
