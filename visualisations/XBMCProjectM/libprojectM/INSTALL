If you just checked out of CVS run './autogen.sh' first. 

If you downloaded a tarball then do this:

./configure 
make
make install (as root)

projectM will install its presets, fonts, and default config in $DATADIR, which defaults to $PREFIX/share/projectM.   So feel free to change these values with the --prefix, or --datadir arguments to ./configure.
