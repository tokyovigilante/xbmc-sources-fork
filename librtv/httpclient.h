/*
 *  Overview of an HTTP request:
 *
 *  1. call hc_start_request() with an URL
 *
 *         hc = hc_start_request("http://192.168.117.3/index.html");
 *         if (!hc) {error}
 *
 *     Right now the address in the URL must be given as an IP address, not
 *     a hostname.  That's a bug, not a feature.
 *     
 *  2. add any necessary headers with hc_add_req_header; the Host header is
 *     created automatically; any others, including User-Agent, must be
 *     explicitely set
 *
 *         if (!hc_add_req_header(hc, "User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (Isn't everything?)") != 0) {error}
 *         
 *  3. send the request; hc_send_request() uses GET, hc_post_request() uses
 *     POST, with the callback function called repeatedly for the data.  It
 *     should return the number of bytes filled in, and signal end of data by
 *     returning 0.
 *
 *         if (!hc_send_request(hc)) {error}
 *
 *  4. check the returned status; 200 is the normal success code, any 2.. code
 *     is a success of some sort. 3.. codes are redirects, 4.. are errors; see
 *     the HTTP specs for more information
 *
 *         if (hc_get_status(hc)/100 != 2) {exception of some sort}
 *
 *  5. Check any response headers you're interested in.
 *
 *         last_modified = hc_lookup_rsp_header(hc, "Last-Modified");
 *         if (!last_modified) {header wasn't supplied}
 *         
 *  6. read the data; if the item is known to be short, you have the memory for
 *     it (2x the data length; half of that as a contiguous block), and don't
 *     mind waiting for all of it, get it all with hc_read_all().  If one of
 *     conditions doesn't hold, call hc_read_pieces().  The callback function
 *     is given a buffer to a chunk of data, the amount of data there, and
 *     a pointer you supply, usually to a structure where it can store state,
 *     get parameters from the original caller and return information to the
 *     original caller
 *
 *         if (!(data = hc_read_all(hc))) {error}
 *
 *     Either way, you own the data chunk -- free() it when you're done with it
 *
 *  7. Clean up
 *
 *         hc_free(hc);
