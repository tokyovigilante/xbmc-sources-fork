/*
 * These all return:
 *   0 for complete success
 *   -1 for a miscellaneous client error
 *   an HTTP error code if the server returned one (300-499 range)
 *   an httpfs error code if the httpfs provider returned one (8082xxxx range,
 *      it seems)
 *   
 * hfs_do_simple: makes a request, collects all the data, gives it back
 * hfs_do_chunked: makes a request, gives it to a callback function in chunks
 *                 the callback does *not* own the data, and must not free it
 *                 or keep a pointer to it; copy it if you want to keep it.
 *                 This difference from the httpclient layer is ugly and may
 *                 change at some point, even though that will cause a memory
 *                 leak in all existing clients
 * hfs_do_post_simple: POSTs a request, using a callback function to get chunks
 *                 of data.  The size must be known beforehand, an apparent
 *                 unfortunate limitation of the ReplayTV httpfs server.
 *                 writefile is the only (current/known) httpfs command that
 *                 needs POST
 *
 * command: the httpfs command, one of: ls fstat volinfo cp mv rm create
 *                                      mkdir readfile writefile
 * arguments are passed as tag/value pairs, NULL terminated.
 * args for cp: src dest
 * arg for create, fstat, ls, mkdir, rm, volinfo: name
 * args for mv: old new
 * args for readfile, writefile: name pos size
